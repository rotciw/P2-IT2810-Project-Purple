        "title": "Fire and Ice",
        "content": "Some say the world will end in fire, \nSome say in ice. \nFrom what Ive tasted of desire \nI hold with those who favor fire. \nBut if it had to perish twice, \nI think I know enough of hate \nTo say that for destruction ice \nIs also great \nAnd would suffice."
    },
    "poem2": {
        "title": "Nothing Gold Can Stay",
        "content": "Nature’s first green is gold,\nHer hardest hue to hold.\nHer early leaf’s a flower;\nBut only so an hour.\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\nSo Eden sank to grief,\nSo dawn goes down to day.\nNothing gold can stay."
    },
    "poem3": {
        "title": "I'm Nobody! Who Are You?",
        "content": "I'm nobody! Who are you?\nAre you nobody, too?\nThen there's a pair of us - don't tell!\nThey'd banish us, you know.\nHow dreary to be somebody!\nHow public, like a frog\nTo tell your name the livelong day\nTo an admiring bog!"

        "title": "First Fig",
        "content": "My candle burns at both ends;\nIt will not last the night;\nBut ah, my foes, and oh, my friends—\nIt gives a lovely light!"
    },
    "poem5": {
        "title": "Trees",
        "content": "I think that I shall never see \nA poem lovely as a tree. \nA tree whose hungry mouth is prest \nAgainst the earth’s sweet flowing breast; \nA tree that looks at God all day, \nAnd lifts her leafy arms to pray; \nA tree that may in Summer wear \nA nest of robins in her hair; \nUpon whose bosom snow has lain; \nWho intimately lives with rain. \nPoems are made by fools like me, \nBut only God can make a tree."
    },
    "poem6": {
        "title": "Risk",
        "content": "And then the day came, \nwhen the risk \nto remain tight \nin a bud \nwas more painful \nthan the risk \nit took \nto Blossom."
    },
    "poem7": {
        "title": "The Dust of Snow",
        "content": "The way a crow \nShook down on me \nThe dust of snow \nFrom a hemlock tree\nHas given my heart \nA change of mood \nAnd saved some part \nOf a day I had rued."
    },
    "poem8": {
        "title": "The Purple Cow",
        "content": "I never saw a Purple Cow, \nI never hope to see one, \nBut I can tell you, anyhow, \nI’d rather see than be one!"
    },
    "poem9": {
        "title": "Harlem",
        "content": "What happens to a dream deferred? \nDoes it dry up like a raisin in the sun? \nOr fester like a sore— \nAnd then run? \nDoes it stink like rotten meat? \nOr crust and sugar over— like a syrupy sweet? \nMaybe it just sags like a heavy load. \nOr does it explode?"
    },
    "poem10": {
        "title": "Death",
        "content": "Nor dread nor hope attend\nA dying animal;\nA man awaits his end\nDreading and hoping all;\nMany times he died,\nMany times rose again.\nA great man in his pride\nConfronting murderous men\nCasts derision upon\nSupersession of breath;\nHe knows death to the bone -\nMan has created death."
    },
    "poem11": {
        "title": "My Life Has Been the Poem",
        "content": "My life has been the poem I would have writ\nBut I could not both live and utter it."
    },
    "poem12": {
        "title": "Much Madness Is Divinest Sense",
        "content": "Much Madness is divinest Sense -\nTo a discerning Eye -\nMuch Sense - the starkest Madness -\n’Tis the Majority\nIn this, as all, prevail -\nAssent - and you are sane -\nDemur - you’re straightway dangerous -\nAnd handled with a Chain -"
